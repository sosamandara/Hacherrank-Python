# Hacherrank-Python
**Homework 1 for ADM-Data Science 2022-2023

I have uploaded the merged PDF with all the submissions done in Hackerrank

I have uploaded the file .py with all the exercises done

I mistakenly wrote the first 8 exercises in PyPy3 but of course the code still run in Python

I found some difficulty with the regex, for some exercises of the regex I saw the discussions on the Hackerrank

Also for the InsertionSort2 I saw discussions on hackerrank website
