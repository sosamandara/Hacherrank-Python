# Hacherrank-Python
**Homework 1 for ADM-Data Science 2022-2023

I have uploaded the merged PDF named "stamps.pdf" with all the submissions done in Hackerrank.

I have uploaded the file .py named "scripts.py" with all the exercises done.
The title of every exercise is commented and then is followed by the related code.

I mistakenly wrote the first 8 exercises in PyPy3 but of course the code still run in Python.

I found some difficulty with the regex, for some exercises of the regex I saw the discussions on the Hackerrank.

Also for the InsertionSort2 I saw discussions on hackerrank website.
